						<b>History</b>
					</p>
					<p>Everyone blames the death for those who die, but have you
						ever think how hard is to work as death? Well, this game shows us
						that it isn't an easy work, it's hard, complicated and with a lots
						of unexpected problems.</p>
					<p>Every dream that we dream, we create a possibility, with
						which we destroy. Every soul, every, creature, or even everyone
						that we create in our dream must be erased from the universe and
						this hard work is led by the only one capable of this hard work,
						the death.</p>
					<p>After years of years in some delusional place, with the
						lonely itself, death is trying to build an army of dream
						destroyer, creatures that are capable of killing with such cold
						and hardness as death itself, but the dreamers became sleeper,
						delusional and depressingly lonely. So, death itself can't handle
						the job and is hiring.</p>
					<p>Welcome to your dreams!</p>
